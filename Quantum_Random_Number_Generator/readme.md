# Quantum Random Number Generator

Welcome to the Quantum Random Number Generator project! 🎲✨

## About the Project
This project was created by me and my friend Arindam Ghosh. It leverages the fascinating principles of quantum mechanics to generate truly random numbers.

## Features
- Utilizes quantum superposition and entanglement
- Produces random numbers with high entropy
- Easy to integrate into various applications

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/D-Ghosh/Qiskit.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd quantum-random-number-generator
